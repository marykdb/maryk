# Properties

Maryk models are built from properties. Each property declares the data type, how the value is validated and how it is stored. This page gives a high‑level overview of the available property types and common concepts for working with them.

## Property Type Characteristics

The table below lists the available property types and where they can be used.

| Type                                | Keyable | Indexable | List/Set | MapKey | MapValue | MultiType |

🔢 All numeric properties such as Int8/16/32/64, UInt8/16/32/64, Float, Double  
🆔 Only the type ID of multi types can be used in the key  
🔑 Only the map key can be indexed  
⤵️ Only nested values inside the embedded object can be indexed

### Characteristic meanings

- **Keyable** – Property can participate in a key. Key properties must be required and final.
- **MapKey** – Property can be used as the key of a map.
- **MapValue** – Property can act as the value in a map.
- **MultiType** – Property can be part of a multi type.
- **List/Set** – Property can be stored inside a list or set.

## Operations

Use property operations such as change, delete or check to inspect or modify values. See the [operations](operations.md) page for details.

## References

[Property references](references.md) point to specific fields within a model and are used for filters and sorting.

## Validation

Every property definition supports validation helpers. Common options include:

* **required** – the property must be set (default `true`)
* **final** – value cannot change once set (default `false`)
* **default** – value to use if none is provided (default `null`)

Each type may define extra validations such as `minSize`, `maxSize`, ranges or regex patterns. Refer to the individual type pages for full details.

# Multi Type Property
A property which can contain a value of one of multiple predefined types. For each type you can 
define a full property definition. Refer to [properties](../properties.md) to see which definition
types can be used.

This multi type property could be useful to use different DataModels inside one field. 
For example in a Timeline in which multiple types of data like posts, photos, videos
events and more are shown, it is useful to store everything in one RootDataModel. This way it 
is easy to query all the time ordered data while they each can have different data structures. 
It is also easy to use other types of structures like single values, maps, sets or even deeper 
multi types.

It is also possible to store the type in the key or index with a Type Reference. This way it will be
cheaper to query on type.

- Kotlin Definition: `MultiTypeDefinition`
- Kotlin Value: `TypedValue`
- Maryk Yaml Definition: `MultiType`

## Usage options
- Value

## Validation Options
- `required` - default true
- `final` - default false
- `unique` - default false

## Other options
- `default` - the default value to be used if value was not set.
- `typeIsFinal` - default true. Set to true to make type non changable once set.
- `definitionMap` - Map which maps shorts to a property definition

## Examples

**Example of a separately defined Multi type enum**
This example is useful if the multi type definition is used in multiple locations.

**Example of a Multi type enum**
```kotlin
sealed class MultiType<T: Any>(
    index: UInt,
    override val definition: IsUsableInMultiType<T, IsPropertyContext>?
) : IndexedEnumImpl<MultiType<*>>(index), MultiTypeEnum<T> {
    object S1: MultiType<String>(1u, StringDefinition())
    object S2: MultiType<Short>(2u, NumberDefinition(type = SInt16))

    class UnknownMultiType(index: UInt, override val name: String): MultiType<Any>(index, null)

    companion object : MultiTypeEnumDefinition<MultiType<out Any>>(
        MultiType::class,
        values = { arrayOf(S1, S2) },
        unknownCreator = ::UnknownMultiType
    )
}
```

**Example of a multi type property definition for use within a Model**
```kotlin
val category by multiType(
    index = 1u,
    required = false,
    final = true,
    typeEnum = MultiType,
    default = MultiType.S1("unknown")
)
```

**Example of a separate Enum property definition**
```kotlin
val def = MultiTypeDefinition(
    required = false,
    final = true,
    typeEnum = MultiType,
    default = MultiType.S1("a value")
)
```

## Storage Byte representation
Depends on the specific implementation. The type id is stored as UInt16 and the value in its
native form.

## Transport Byte representation
The multitype is encoded as an embedded object within a length delimited tag/value. It then 
contains 1 tag/value pair in which the tag is the type index and the value contains the actual value. 

## String representation
TypeID as a `UInt16` encoded to string.

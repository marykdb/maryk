## What is Maryk?

Maryk is a Kotlin Multiplatform toolkit for data. You describe your data once — with types and validation — and use that same model across clients and servers.

- **Strong types, one schema** for JVM, Android/Android Native, iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, Linux, Windows, and JS.
- **Version‑aware storage** with historic reads, change streams, and efficient sync.
- **Portable serialization** (YAML/JSON streaming, compact ProtoBuf).
- **Pluggable stores** with the same API (In‑Memory, RocksDB, FoundationDB).

## Highlights

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="One Model" icon="seti:csv">
		Define your schema once in Kotlin and reuse it everywhere — fewer mismatches, better autocomplete.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Versioned Storage" icon="seti:clock">
		Ask for “only changes” or “as of time T”. Stream live updates without extra infrastructure.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Portable Serialization" icon="seti:json">
		Streaming YAML/JSON and compact ProtoBuf with consistent encoders/decoders across platforms.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Unified Queries" icon="seti:plan">
		One request API on every engine: filters, reference graphs (field selection), ordering, limits, aggregations.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Pluggable Stores" icon="seti:db">
		Start in‑memory for tests, embed RocksDB for apps, or run FoundationDB for ACID and scale — same API.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Kotlin Multiplatform" icon="seti:kotlin">
		Run on JVM, Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, and JS — share your model and logic.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick start

1) **Add the dependency**

```kotlin
implementation("io.maryk:maryk-core:<version>")
```

2) **Define a model**

```kotlin
object Person : RootDataModel<Person>() {
  val firstName by string(index = 1u)
  val lastName by string(index = 2u)
}
```

3) **Create, validate, serialize**

```kotlin
val jane = Person.create { firstName with "Jane"; lastName with "Doe" }
Person.validate(jane)
val json = person.toJson(pretty = true)
```

Start with the overview in [What is Maryk?](what/) and the short case for [Why Maryk?](why/).

When you’re ready to dig in:

- [Data Models](data-modeling/datamodels/) and [Properties](data-modeling/properties/) (types, operations, references)
- [Querying](querying/) with filters, [reference graphs](querying/reference-graphs/), ordering, and [aggregations](querying/aggregations/)
- [Serialization](serialization/) (YAML/JSON/ProtoBuf)
- [Versioning](data-modeling/versioning/) for historic views and change/update streams

Picking storage? See [Stores](stores/) for the overview, or jump straight to
[In‑Memory](stores/memory/), [RocksDB](stores/rocksdb/), or [FoundationDB](stores/foundationdb/).
